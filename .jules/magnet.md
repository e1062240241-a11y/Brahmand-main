# Magnet Codebase Map & Learnings

## 2026-09-04 - Profile to Jaap Tab Cross-Feature Route
**Learning:** Adding subtle, language-aware CTA buttons directly below user stats on high-frequency screens (like Profile) drives discovery of core habitual practices (like Jaap) without intruding on the user experience.
**Action:** Created `Pressable` link navigating to `/(tabs)/jaap` in `frontend/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` respecting Hindi/English preference.

## 2026-09-05 - Language-Aware Panchang Empty State & Loading Polish
**Learning:** Blank or untranslated loading and empty states in core daily features (such as Panchang) disconnect non-English users. Ensuring Devanagari Hindi support in `BrandedLoading` messages and empty states maintains high retention and trust.
**Action:** Updated `frontend/src/components/panchang/PanchangTabContent.tsx` and `frontend/app/panchang.tsx` to conditionally render warm, polite Hindi copy when `language === 'hi'`.
